> [!NOTE] Description
> These are refined and standalone pieces of knowledge, often derived from your literature or fleeting notes, or any other source of information. They should be written in your own words and should be comprehensive enough to understand even years later. The aim of these notes is to capture insights that are worth preserving and can contribute to future work or thought.

> [!NOTE] Description
> The main purpose of literature notes in the Zettelkasten method is to extract and distill information in a way that facilitates understanding, recall, and application of the knowledge in different contexts. They serve as the foundational building blocks for the next stage, which is the creation of permanent notes, which are written to be evergreen and context-free.

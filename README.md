Welcome to my Obsidian Vault, a **minimalistic** and versatile workspace where I store knowledge and keep track of my life.

The emphasis is on `minimalistic`. I believe that the doing is as important as the end result. 
If you are one of those persons who just wants to click around and magically have everything generated, this is not the vault for you.

This Vault only uses the core plugins, 

* **Unique note creator** used to create fleeting notes in the `Inbox`
* **Daily notes** used to create the daily notes in the `Bullet Journal`

# How do I use it

## For [bullet journaling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_journal)

I assigned a keyboard shortcut (`CTRL+J`) for opening today's daily note. This will create a new daily note based on its template directly in the `Bullet Journal` folder.

## For capturing my thoughts

This is something I need to be able to do as fast as possible. I use the `CTRL+Space` shortcut to create a new fleeting note in `Inbox`. I do not care about the title of this note because a fleeting note is just a temporary note. I review the `Inbox`  periodically to extract useful information (ideas, tasks, thoughts) and create permanent notes. At the end, the fleeting note gets deleted or moved to the `Archive` folder.

## Digesting new media

Independent on the media content (articles, books, videos) the process starts with creating a fleeting note in ``Inbox``. While engaging with each piece of content I try to capture the key points and ideas that resonate with me. I would write down notes, quotes and references to the original content.
When I review these fleeting notes from my `Inbox` I create a new entry into the `Media Consumption` based on the template. I create literature notes for the content worth storing and link them to the media consumption entry.


## Building a second brain

You should read about yourself about the [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) method, make your own opinion and create your own workflow. One thing to keep in mind, surprisingly often avoided by those explaining this remarkably efficient method, is that [Niklas Luhmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas_Luhmann) had over 90000 (ninety thousand) hand written index cards in his slip box. Just imagine how much he must have read to generate such a "second brain".

# Folder structure

Here are shortly described only those folders which actually need some explanation. 

## Inbox

One finds here all the ``Fleeting Notes``. These are temporary notes, quick thoughts, or ideas that you want to capture. They are often the raw material for your permanent notes. They are typically quick to write and are intended for later processing and refinement.
Every ``Fleeting Note`` will automatically be created in this folder based on the [[New Fleeting Note]] template.

## Bullet Journal

This folder stores all the daily notes and thoughts. Every ``Daily Note`` will automatically be created in this folder based on the [[New Daily Note]] template.

## Second Brain

This is where I store, organize, and nurture my knowledge base using the [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) notes structure, a highly efficient method for knowledge management and idea generation.  
In this folder, you will find only three types of notes: 
* **Permanent Notes** stored in the `Slip Box` folder. These are refined and standalone pieces of knowledge, often derived from your literature or fleeting notes, or any other source of information. They should be written in your own words and should be comprehensive enough to understand even years later. The aim of these notes is to capture insights that are worth preserving and can contribute to future work or thought.
* **Map of Content Notes**: These are overview notes that provide a high-level view of a specific topic or area of knowledge. They serve as a guide to navigate the related notes within a certain field. They link to various related notes and can be continually updated as new insights or connections are made. 
* **Literature Notes** stored inside the `Media Consumption`. They serve as the initial step in processing and internalizing information from various sources like books, articles, lectures, or any form of content.

The fundamental principle of a  [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) is its interconnectedness. Each note should link to others, creating a network of ideas that can be navigated freely. Always strive to add links to other relevant notes and consider using tags to make notes easier to find.  
Remember, this isn't just an information dump; it's a system for nurturing understanding and generating new insights.


# PS

* You are maybe wondering why is there no template for `Map of Content Notes`? While you generate more and more notes, some permanent notes might look like map of content notes or vice-versa. Keep in mind that your knowledge changes over time and your notes structure shall adapt accordingly. A `Map of Content Note` is just a permanent note stored in the `Map of Content` folder.
* Why no databases and dashboards? I would answer this question with a question: why do you need to track your life with automatically generated dashboards? If you actually have a good reason for it, feel free to adapt your vault to your needs. For me personally, the local and global graphs are enough to see my second brain growing. I use the YAML metadata just in case I might need to generate some dashboards in the future.
